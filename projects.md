      <h5 class="mb-0">Project Splatter <span class="badge badge-success">iOS Mobile</span> <span class="badge badge-info">Swift & PHP</span></h5>
    </div>
    
    <p class="card-text text-left">A project I worked on with Cardiff University to build an iOS application to allow users to submit roadkill sightings for their research project. Built in Swift with an associated server support API backend built in PHP, a web application built in PHP for results, and desktop applications for viewing & exporting results built in Swift and Java.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="card-text text-left">I love playing the ukulele but can never remember the chords - so this is a useful reference! Uses SVG for the rendering of the chords on a virtual ukulele fretboard rather than having to laboriously make an image for each chord, and has a responsive design so works well on an mobile phone whilst out performing! ðŸ˜‚</p>

      <h5 class="mb-0">php-skydrive Client Library <span class="badge badge-success">Web</span> <span class="badge badge-info">PHP </span> <span class="badge badge-warning">Deprecated </span></h5>
    </div>
    <p class="card-text text-left">The first third-party PHP client library for interacting with the Microsoft SkyDrive (now OneDrive) service. Abstracts away the complexity of making requests to the HTTP API and deals with oAuth so PHP developers can use familiar PHP objects to interact with files on the platform. 2019: Microsoft have made some changes to the API so some features may not work - I will try to update the library at some point!
