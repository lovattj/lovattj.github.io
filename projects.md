    <p class="card-text text-left">A project I worked on with Cardiff University to build an iOS application to allow users to submit roadkill sightings for their research project. Built in Swift with an associated server support API backend built in PHP, a web application built in PHP for results, and desktop applications for viewing & exporting results built in Swift and Java.</p>

    <p class="card-text text-left">A customised website for a Student Union using the Shopify platform. Integrated with the Shopify sales system so users could purchase products, as well as static pages to display information about SU services and personnel, and AJAX being used with an external server to add functionality not supported directly by Shopify.</p>

    <p class="card-text text-left">I love playing the ukulele but can never remember the chords - so this is a useful reference! Uses SVG for the rendering of the chords on a virtual ukulele fretboard rather than having to laboriously make an image for each chord.</p>
